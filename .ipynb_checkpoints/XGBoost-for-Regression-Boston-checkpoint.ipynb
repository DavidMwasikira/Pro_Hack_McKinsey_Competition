    "### XGBoost's hyperparameters\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point, before building the model, you should be aware of the tuning parameters that XGBoost provides. Well, there are a plethora of tuning parameters for tree-based learners in XGBoost and you can read all about them here. But the most common ones that you should know are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **learning_rate:** step size shrinkage used to prevent overfitting. Range is [0,1]\n",
    "- **max_depth:** determines how deeply each tree is allowed to grow during any boosting round.\n",
    "- **subsample:** percentage of samples used per tree. Low value can lead to underfitting.\n",
    "- **colsample_bytree:** percentage of features used per tree. High value can lead to overfitting.\n",
    "- **n_estimators:** number of trees you want to build.\n",
    "- **objective:** determines the loss function to be used like reg:linear for regression problems, reg:logistic for classification problems with only decision, binary:logistic for classification problems with probability.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "XGBoost also supports regularization parameters to penalize models as they become more complex and reduce them to simple (parsimonious) models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **gamma:** controls whether a given node will split based on the expected reduction in loss after the split. A higher value leads to fewer splits. Supported only for tree-based learners.\n",
    "- **alpha:** L1 regularization on leaf weights. A large value leads to more regularization.\n",
    "- **lambda:** L2 regularization on leaf weights and is smoother than L1 regularization.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth mentioning that though you are using trees as your base learners, you can also use XGBoost's relatively less popular linear base learners and one other tree learner known as dart. All you have to do is set the booster parameter to either gbtree (default),gblinear or dart.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you will create the train and test set for cross-validation of the results using the train_test_split function from sklearn's model_selection module with test_size size equal to 20% of the data. Also, to maintain reproducibility of the results, a random_state is also assigned."

    "\n",
    "In order to build more robust models, it is common to do a k-fold cross validation where all the entries in the original training dataset are used for both training as well as validation. Also, each entry is used for validation just once. XGBoost supports k-fold cross validation via the cv() method. All you have to do is specify the nfolds parameter, which is the number of cross validation sets you want to build. Also, it supports many other parameters (check out this link) like:\n",
